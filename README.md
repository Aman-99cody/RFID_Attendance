# RFID_Attendance
This Project Involves RFID TAG based  attendance system with RFID READER using UART protocol on AVR atmega16o RFID tag and a RFID reader module detects employees id cards(embedded RFID tag) for their check-in.

o Provides a smooth passage for employees with an attendance record as well as securing the organisation
  My role-  Programming the microcontroller
  Challenges faced-
  Exactly synchronizing the database of the employees 
  Efficient detection of individual codes 
  Program to avoid unauthorised access
  final outcome
  Successfully implemented this system with smooth access for employees
